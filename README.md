Burger APP:

The burger app takes a simple idea and improves upon it.

This app uses a sample of the models that will be used for project two for the linking of files and controller variables to create an app that allows for all facets of learning to be connected thus far, with javascript connecting against a front and back end. The overall goal of what I created is to have an online and offline application be able to show whether or not a burger has been devoured, and if it hasn't been give it a button that allows for it to be devoured, and move from the non-eaten category to the eaten category.

The app uses the orm configuration which will be tossed out for project two. It also uses MYSQL, Heroku, Github, and overall correct path structures to allow for this to work. For my personal project I used some images of a denver, croque, and mushroom burger to represent different "flavors" of burgers.
